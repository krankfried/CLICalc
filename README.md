Hey everyone!

This is my very first C++ project, and I’m super excited to share it with you! It’s a simple CLI calculator right now, so you can do basic math like 2+2 or 10000000*3, but just one calculation at a time (I know, small steps).
What It Can Do (So Far)

    Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
    Runs entirely in the command line – no fancy GUI yet, but it works!

What's Next?

I’ve got some big plans! Here’s what I hope to add soon:

    Multiple Calculations: So you won’t be limited to just one calculation at a time.
    GUI: Thinking about adding a graphical interface to make it look cool and be even easier to use, but thats a big topic on its own to dive into i suppose!
I haven't and will not use ai for this code in the future, because it feels like i teach myself to rely on the ai to help me out every time, that's not what i want to achieve!
I’m really looking forward to building this out more and learning as I go. Feel free to check it out, try it out, and share any feedback – I’d love to hear what you think!
