Hey everyone!

This is my very first C++ project, and I’m super excited to share it with you! It’s a simple CLI calculator right now, so you can do basic math like 2+2 or 10000000*3, but just one calculation at a time (I know, small steps).
What It Can Do (So Far)

    Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
    Runs entirely in the command line – no fancy GUI yet, but it works!

What's Next?

I’ve got some big plans! Here’s what I hope to add soon:

    Multiple Calculations: So you won’t be limited to just one calculation at a time.
    Scientific Mode: For more advanced calculations!
    GUI: Thinking about adding a graphical interface to make it look cool and be even easier to use, but thats a big topic on its own to dive into i suppose!
    
I haven't used AI for this code, and I don’t plan to in the future. Relying on AI to solve my problems isn't the path I want to take—I want to learn and grow on my own. I'm excited to keep building this project and learning along the way. Feel free to check it out, give it a try, and share any thoughts you have. I'd really like to hear what you think!"
